  <h2>Hi, I'm Eric.</h2>
  <br>
  <h3> Full-stack web-developer | Ardent world traveller | Fanboy of DC comicbooks </h3>
  <br>
  <p>
    I graduated from California State University San Marcos in 2013 with a degree in mass media. After graduating, I became a <span><a href="http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching-qualifications/celta/"> CELTA </a></span> certified English Language Teacher, moved to Japan, and worked there for a year.
    <br>
    <br>
    As a full-stack web developer with a background in mass-media and education, I am an effective communicator who uses practical and resourceful methods to achieve goals. I create an innovative and productive work environment through fostering strong cohesive working relationships.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you're in the DC area, I'd love to grab coffee or a beer.
