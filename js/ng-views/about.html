    <h2>Hi, I'm Eric.</h2>
    <br>
    <h4> Full-stack web-developer | Ardent world traveller | DC comics fanboy </h4>
    <br>
    <p>
      I graduated from California State University San Marcos in 2013 with a degree in mass media. After graduating, I became a <span><a href="http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching-qualifications/celta/" target="_blank"> CELTA </a></span> certified English Language Teacher, moved to Japan, and worked there for a year. My fascination for technology grew exponentially in Japan. A year later, I moved to Washington, DC and I was inspired to join the <span><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank"> Web Development Immersive Course</a></span>, by my roommate who is an alum of the course. I love to learn, I love to build, and I love to be creative. I'm a thrilled to have found my passion in web development.
      <br>
      <br>
      As a full-stack web developer with a background in mass-media and education, I am an effective communicator who uses practical and resourceful methods to achieve goals. I create an innovative and productive work environment through fostering strong cohesive working relationships.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you're in the DC area, I'd love to grab coffee or a beer.
